# AspNetCore2CoreUI

This repo contains a standard ASP.NET MVC Core 2 Visual Studio 2017 template project with a twist.

The [CoreUI Open Source Bootstrap 4 Admin Template](http://coreui.io/) was adapted to replace the default style, to get a good starting point for an elegant solution in your next project.

This repo goes along with my blog posts:

* **ENGLISH:** [Building elegant applications with ASP.NET MVC Core 2 and Bootstrap 4 using CoreUI](http://www.coderepo.blog/posts/building-elegant-applications-aspnet-mvc-core-2-bootstrap-4-coreui/)
* **SPANISH:** [Construyendo aplicaciones elegantes con ASP.NET MVC Core 2 y Bootstrap 4 usando CoreUI](http://www.coderepo.blog/posts/construyendo-aplicaciones-elegantes-aspnet-mvc-core-2-bootstrap-4-coreui/)

In the blog posts I explain the process of adapting the [CoreUI](http://coreui.io/) template, getting acquainted with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) in the process.

I consider this a stepping stone on my way to Javascript front-end development, coming from a C# back-end background.

Hope this can help you too on your way to become a better developer.
